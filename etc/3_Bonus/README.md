# Bonus Topics

Provided workshops 1 and 2 have been completed successfully, one or more bonus items below may be attempted.  Additional consideration will be given for any bonus topics attempted and/or completed.  However, that consideration is predicated on successful completion of the base workshops.

Bonus topics do NOT have to be attempted in any particular order.  The participant may choose which items they would like to attempt.

#### Expand on workshops 1 and/or 2 in one or more of the following ways

* Testing
  * Add [Inspec](http://inspec.io/) tests
  * Add [ChefSpec](http://sethvargo.github.io/chefspec/) unit tests
* Refactor to make use of community cookbooks inside of your cookbook [Community Cookbooks](http://supermarket.chef.io)
  >NOTE: If this item is selected, ensure that working versions of the base workshops are availble to show and discuss (e.g create a git feature branch for the refactor and leave `master` as the working version)
* Refactor to support multiple operating systems
  * E.G. Ubuntu in addition to RHEL7

#### Complete one or more addtional workshops

* Awesome Appliance Repair
* Middleman
